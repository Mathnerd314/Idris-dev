@inproceedings{NanevskiAAMorrisett2008,
abstract = {We describe an axiomatic extension to the Coq proof assistant, that supports writing, reasoning about, and extracting higher-order, dependently-typed programs with side-effects. Coq already includes a powerful functional language that supports dependent types, but that language is limited to pure, total functions. The key contribution of our extension, which we call Ynot, is the added support for computations that may have effects such as non-termination, accessing a mutable store, and throwing/catching exceptions. The axioms of Ynot form a small trusted computing base which has been formally justified in our previous work on Hoare Type Theory (HTT). We show how these axioms can be combined with the powerful type and abstraction mechanisms of Coq to build higher-level reasoning mechanisms which in turn can be used to build realistic, verified software components. To substantiate this claim, we describe here a representative series of modules that implement imperative finite maps, including support for a higher-order (effectful) iterator. The implementations range from simple (e.g., association lists) to complex (e.g., hash tables) but share a common interface which, abstracts the implementation details and ensures that the modules properly implement the finite map abstraction.

abstract = {In these lecture notes we give an introduction to functional programming with dependent types. We use the dependently typed programming language Agda which is based on ideas in Martin-L\"{o}f type theory and Martin-L\"{o}fs logical framework. We begin by showing how to do simply typed functional programming, and discuss the differences between Agdas type system and the Hindley-Milner type system, which underlies mainstream typed functional programming languages like Haskell and ML. We then show how to employ dependent types for programming with functional data structures such as vectors and binary search trees. We go on to explain the Curry-Howard identification of propositions and types, and how it makes Agda not only a programming language but also a programming logic. According to Curry-Howard, we also identify programs and proofs, something which is possible only by requiring that all program terminate. However, we show in the final section a method for encoding general and possibly partial recursive functions as total functions using dependent types.},

abstract = {As software becomes more and more complex, it is more and more important to structure it well. Well-structured software is easy to write, easy to debug, and provides a collection of modules that can be re-used to reduce future programming costs. Conventional languages place conceptual limits on the way problems can be modularised. Functional languages push those limits back. In this paper we show that two features of functional languages in particular, higher-order functions and lazy evaluation, can contribute greatly to modularity. As examples, we manipulate lists and trees, program several numerical algorithms, and implement the alpha-beta heuristic (an algorithm from Artificial Intelligence used in game-playing programs). Since modularity is the key to successful programming, functional languages are vitally important to the real world.},

abstract = {Massive amounts of useful data are stored and processed in ad hoc formats for which common tools like parsers, printers, query engines and format converters are not readily available. In this paper, we explain the design and implementation of PADS/ML , a new language and system that facilitates the generation of data processing tools for ad hoc formats. The PADS/ML design includes features such as dependent, polymorphic and recursive datatypes, which allow programmers to describe the syntax and semantics of ad hoc data in a concise, easy-to-read notation. The PADS/ML implementation compiles these descriptions into ml structures and functors that include types for parsed data, functions for parsing and printing, and auxiliary support for user-specified, format-dependent and format-independent tool generation.},

@article{McBride2004a,
abstract = {ABSTRACT Pattern matching has proved an extremely powerful and durable notion in functional programming. This paper contributes a new programming notation for type theory which elaborates the notion in various ways. First, as is by now quite well-known in the type theory community, definition by pattern matching becomes a more discriminating tool in the presence of dependent types, since it refines the explanation of types as well as values. This becomes all the more true in the presence of the rich class of datatypes known as inductive families (Dybjer, 1991). Secondly, as proposed by Peyton Jones (1997) for Haskell, and independently rediscovered by us, subsidiary case analyses on the results of intermediate computations, which commonly take place on the right-hand side of definitions by pattern matching, should rather be handled on the left. In simply-typed languages, this subsumes the trivial case of Boolean guards; in our setting it becomes yet more powerful. Thirdly, elementary pattern matching decompositions have a well-defined interface given by a dependent type; they correspond to the statement of an induction principle for the datatype. More general, user-definable decompositions may be defined which also have types of the same general form. Elementary pattern matching may therefore be recast in abstract form, with a semantics given by translation. Such abstract decompositions of data generalize Wadler&apos;s (1987) notion of &lsquo;view&rsquo;. The programmer wishing to introduce a new view of a type mathitT, and exploit it directly in pattern matching, may do so via a standard programming idiom. The type theorist, looking through the Curry&ndash;Howard lens, may see this as proving a theorem, one which establishes the validity of a new induction principle for mathitT. We develop enough syntax and semantics to account for this high-level style of programming in dependent type theory. We close with the development of a typechecker for the simply-typed lambda calculus, which furnishes a view of raw terms as either being well-typed, or containing an error. The implementation of this view is ipso facto a proof that typechecking is decidable.},

@inproceedings{Augustsson1998,
abstract = {Cayenne is a Haskell-like language. The main difference between Haskell and Cayenne is that Cayenne has dependent types, i.e., the result type of a function may depend on the argument value , and types of record components (which can be types or values) may depend on other components. Cayenne also combines the syntactic categories for value expressions and type expressions; thus reducing the number of language concepts. Having dependent types and combined type and value expressions makes the language very powerful. It is powerful enough that a special module concept is unnecessary; ordinary records suffice. It is also powerful enough to encode predicate logic at the type level, allowing types to be used as specifications of programs. However, this power comes at a cost: type checking of Cayenne is undecidable. While this may appear to be a steep price to pay, it seems to work well in practice.},

abstract = {Sized types are a modular and theoretically well-understood tool for checking termination of recursive and productivity of corecursive definitions. The essential idea is to track structural descent and guardedness in the type system to make termination checking robust and suitable for strong abstractions like higher-order functions and polymorphism. To study the application of sized types to proof assistants and programming languages based on dependent type theory, we have implemented a core language, MiniAgda, with explicit handling of sizes. New considerations were necessary to soundly integrate sized types with dependencies and pattern matching, which was made possible by concepts such as inaccessible patterns and parametric function spaces. This paper provides an introduction to MiniAgda by example and informal explanations of the underlying principles.},

abstract = {The recent success of languages like Agda and Coq demonstrates the potential of using dependent types for programming. These systems rely on many high-level features like datatype definitions, pattern matching and implicit arguments to facilitate the use of the languages. However, these features complicate the metatheoretical study and are a potential source of bugs. To address these issues we introduce $\Pi$$\Sigma$, a dependently typed core language. It is small enough for metatheoretical study and the type checker is small enough to be formally verified. In this language there is only one mechanism for recursionused for types, functions and infinite objectsand an explicit mechanism to control unfolding, based on lifted types. Furthermore structural equality is used consistently for values and types; this is achieved by a new notion of $\alpha$-equality for recursive definitions. We show, by translating several high-level constructions, that $\Pi$$\Sigma$ is suitable as a core language for dependently typed programming.},

@article{Wadler2001,
abstract = {The use of monads to structure functional programs is described. Monads provide a convenient framework for simulating effects found in other languages, such as global state, exception handling, output, or non-determinism. Three case studies are looked at in detail: how monads ease the modification of a simple evaluator; how monads act as the basis of a datatype of arrays subject to in-place update; and how monads can be used to build parsers.},

@article{Xi1998,
abstract = {We present a type-based approach to eliminating array bound checking and list tag checking by conservatively extending Standard ML with a restricted form of dependent types. This enables the programmer to capture more invariants through types while type-checking remains decidable in theory and can still be performed efficiently in practice. We illustrate our approach through concrete examples and present the result of our preliminary experiments which support support the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach.},
